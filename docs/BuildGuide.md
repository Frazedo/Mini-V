# Build Steps for Mini-V

Warning: this guide is a work-in-progress

## Tips

* Use an ultra flat surface for assembly of frame
* Take a file or flattening stone to all mating surfaces, including all clips
* Panel clips should be snapped in diagonally towards the extrusion

## Gather Hardware
See [BOM](./docs/BOM) for Bill of Materials

## Print Parts
See [Printing Parts](./docs/PrintingParts)

## Heat Sets
* Grab some coffee, I hope you like putting in heat sets as there are many

## üîÅ Build left side
* Assemble 2 uprights and the bottom extrusion using blind joints M5x16 (2)  
  * (optional) Bottom of bottom extrusion will need (2) T-nuts
  * You should have a U shape

### Building Z0 axis
* Add the Z0 motor mount using a M3x30 (1) side and M3x8 (1) screw on top
  * Note: leave these screws slightly loose until the final frame tighten
* Loosly mount Z-rail clips
  * Order from bottom up

</p>

* Add the z-rail to clips using M3x6 (8)
  * Note: don't tighten down until all screws are in
  * Note: add your clip so carriage doesn't fall out when flipping upside down
* Tighten down Z-rail clips using ball end hex
  * Note: try to pursuade the rail down towards extrusion prior to tightening
  * Note: the top clip should line-up or you may need to adjust the clips

### Rear E-bay mount (low voltage)
* Note: leave these screws for the Ebay mount loose until later, otherwise it might tweak the frame
* Add T-nuts to high-voltage ebay part using M3x10 (1) side middle and M3x6 (1) side top

<p align="center">
  <img width="600" src="../images/03_ebay_tnuts.jpg">
</p>

* Roll-in a bottom T-nut in position then slide on ebay part and fasten bottom with M3x8 (1)


### Y Rail mount
* Slide 269mm (2) steel rods into Y-rail mount (2)
  * Note: check the length is not longer than 270

<p align="center">
  <img width="600" src="../images/04_y_rail_check.jpg">
</p>

* Fasten the Y-rail using M3x6 (10) to get proper spacing
  * Note: your Y-rail needs to be cut precisely for this design
* Add T-nuts to each using M3x10 (2) then slide-in between extrusions
* Use calipers and set to 140mm from very top to top of mount
  * Note: you should see 245mm from top of lower extrustion to bottom of mount
  * Note: this is a critical measurement for this build so take your time to get it right
  * TODO: Add diagram
* Tighten down Y-rail mount on both sides

### Front and rear idlers
* Flatten mating surfaces and screw together the motor idler using M3x20 (2)
  * Note: don't add the bearing stacks until after it is mounted
* Screw motor idler to rear using M3x8 (4)
* Flatten mating surfaces and screw together front idler using M3x20 (1)
* Screw front idler to front using M3x8 (4)
* Add front guidler and idler bearings
* Add the rear double idler bearings to the rear motor idler
  * Note: don't install the single bearing until after belts are routed

### XY Joint
* Flatten mating surfaces and screw together the XY Joint using M3x20 (1)
  * Note: Your choice to have screws come from top or bottom
* Screw XY Joint onto Y Rail using M3x6 (4) FHCS
  * Note: You can add bearing stacks later
* Add the rear single bearing, it should be flipped
  * Note: don't install the front single bearing until after belts are routed

### Finish clips and side frame
* Add the top extrusion using the blind joints M5x16 (2)
  * (optional) Top extrusion will need (2) T-nuts

## üîÅ Build right side
* Repeat all left side steps (mirror)

Show picture of both sides here

## Join sides and finish frame
* Slide motors onto rear 279mm steel rods (2)
* Bring the two sides together by sliding rods into motor idler and on each side
* Finish the frame on a flat surface using blind joints and M5x16 (8)
  * Note: ensure frame is square
  * Tighten all the screws you left loose (ebay mounts and front motor mounts)
  * Congrats, it is starting to look like a printer

### Add AB Motors
* Add the motors to the motor mount using M3x35 (4) and M3x8 (4)
  * Note: wires should exit away from center

  Show picture here

## Rear Z Motor Mount
* Note: Depending on printer tolerance, use a 5mm reamer on all the parts prior to joining them together
* Start with the Z1 motor mount and add the metal 280mm rods
  * Note: Consider sanding the mating edges so the parts come together without gaps
* Here is the order top to bottom, you'll put bottom in first:
  * bed_Z1_Rail_Mount_top
  * bed_Z1_Rail_Mount
  * bed_Z1_Rail_Mount_Wire_Manage
  * bed_Z1_Rail_Mount
  * bed_Z1_Rail_Mount
* Use M3x20 (2) for lower screws, leave loose
* Measure 135mm to center of rear screw from both side extrusions
* Use M3x6 (1) and leave it loose too, you need to slide side to side to finalize the fit
* Install the E3EZ mount to the low voltage ebay mount using M3x8 (2)
* Install the mid panels now help get the alignment of Z1
  * Note: this assumes your mid panels are accurately cut, otherwise use calipers to get it perfectly center

### Rear Z Motor Mount Clamp
* Add the tensioner knobs from behind into the back clamp using M5 nuts (2)
* Add your hex head M4x40 (2) into the back clamp to install the knobs
* Slide the clamp down over the vertical rods while passing the horizontal rods
  * Note: this part is tricky as you also need to line the hex head screws into motor mounts
* Add the front of the clamp using M3x8 (4)
* Before you completely tighten the clamp, check Z1 is centered and square with the frame
* Tighten the Z1 Motor Mount

At this point the Z1 rail should feel very rigid



## X-Rail
* Build the X-Rail backer using 280mm carbon rods (2)
  * Add a picture here
* Mount the X-Rail (choose your best rail) using M3x8 (8)
  * Note: make sure you center things before screwing to the XY Joints
* Screw X-Rail Backer to XY-Joints M3x8 (4)

## Belts
* Route the belts like any standard Core-XY machine
* If you haven't put the motor tensioners in, put them in now
* ProTip: leave the front XY bearing out while routing belts and leave the front motor idlers bearings out
* Add picture


## Add Z Motors and feet
* Turn the printer upside down
* Mount all three integrated lead-screw motors using M3x6 (9)

## Add the feet
* Add the foot spacers (4)
* Each foot requires a M4 thumbscrew (4) and M3x16 (4)

















## Front Idlers
* Sand mating surfaces
* Build stackup, left side has bearing at top, right side at bottom
* Front idler uses normal bearings
* Behind guidler uses smaller bearing
* You can screw together prior to bolting on Y-Rail
* Consider using a clamp to make sure top and bottom flush with Y-Rail
* Screw down M3x6 (4) on each side

## Front Z Motor Mounts
* Fasten inside using M3X16 (2) each side
* Note: M3 holes could be bigger so screw falls into place better
* Add front motors using M3x6 (3) for each side
* Note: they sink a .75mm too much, add beef
* Note: Motors actually fit in after feet

## Front Z Rail Mounts
* Start at the bottom, should lay on top of motor mount
* Use M3x8 (4) for each mount on both sides
* Leave loose (except for bottom) until you get a rail to align holes
* Use M3x6 (8) to fasten rail


## Rear Z Rail Mount
* Stack up the rear "horseshoe" mount on the CF rods
* Bottom up order: 2 normal, 3rd is for wiring, 4th is normal and 5th is "throne" top
* Leave about 27mm at bottom for putting in Z motor mount
* Check orientation as you stack them up for mounting rail
* Add stack to Z motor mount, rods will stick below motor mount ~6mm
* Add rear Z rail, it should sit upon extrusion
* Use every screw hole except top, keep plastic clip in place until later
* Tighten them down in any order, we are mounting to plastic after all
* Add optional 2mm metal pins to lock all the stack together

## Bottom Panel
* Panel should fit in under front motor connectors
* Add clips
* 

## Feet
* Use M4 thumb screw and M3x16 (or M3x18 if you have them) to attach to tiny skirts
* Repeat for all 4 feet
* Attach feet to bottom of frame using M3x6 (2) per foot
* Note: if using roll-in nuts, make sure long side is towards corner
* Note: Need to beef up the M3x6 recessed screws

## Front Bed Rail Mounts
* Add M5x80mm (2) steel rods to mounts
* Attach to rail using M3x8 (4)
* Next add POM nut, twist on and screw down using M3x8 (2)
* Note: top may tighter than bottom, that is normal it should square up
* Test the up and down movement has no binding
* Add the 5x10x20 strong magnets to carriers
* Screw on the cover to keep magnets from sliding out
* Add on to the 80mm steel rods

## Bed Kinematics
* Use M4x10 (3) to screw on 10mm balls using 2 washers for spacing
* Test fit bed, should fit firmly in place with very little movement

## PSU
* For each PSU mount, add some 3mm thick foam between bracket and deck panel
* Add the PSU mounts using M3x8 for both brackets, tighten after a test fit
* Make sure the PSU is snug against the high voltage side front Z motor bracket

## XY Joints
* Note: you have the option to screw from bottom (preferred) or top (easier access)
* Use M3x8 FHCS (4) to mount both left and right XY joints
* Note: you'll need a ball end to tighten the back screws down
* Next, add the bearings and fasten using M3x30 (4)
* Finally, add M3x20 bolt top and bottom together

## X Rail Beam
* Align the parts on the M5x285 CF rods, use the rail as a guide
* Dry fit on the XY joints before tighting down
* Use M3x6 (8) to fasten rail to beam
* Use M3x6 (2) to fasten beam to XY joints

## Motor Mount Bearings
* Add the bearings in the motor mounts to match your front orientation
* Back corners should be your only double stacks
* ProTip: lube top of motor so belts are easier to tension later
* Mount motors using M3x8, just the back two screws for now
* Motors should be nearest the corners to allow tensioning later
* Adjust the motor pully so it aligns with bearings
* Note: there is very little clearance here and the pully will rub CF rod if you aren't careful 
* It is best to route the belts prior to putting top of motor mounts on


## Belt Tension
* Put M3x35 (2) into the motors but don't tighten yet
* You should be able to slide the motor back and forth by hand
* Add M3x12 tensioning screw to help dial-in the tension later
* Mount the boop X-rail to X carriage and sandwich the belts following boop directions
* You can now dail-in the tension so the gantry hits the front and back perfectly

## Rear Z Top Mount
* Put M3x8 (4) into the top clamp, leave loose for now
* Use a square to ensure the hole assembly is square to the frame
* Double check the top clamp is centered between the motor mounts
* Tighten the clamp

## Low-voltage E-Bay
* Mount top using M3x8 and bottom using M3x8 but leave bottom loose
* Squeeze mid panel between rear Z and side
* Tighten bottom screw then add E3EZ IO shield, it should snap into place
* Bolt E3EZ board to bracket using M3x6 (4)
* Bolt bracket into side mount using M3x8, you may need a small hex key here
