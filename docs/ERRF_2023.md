* Amazing experience
* Wasn't show ready
* Build during show
* Attendee interest
* Feedback
* Lessons learned
* Next steps

## Overview
On September 29th, I (JV) disassembled Mini-V.001, packed it into a suitcase and flew it to DC/Baltimore for ERRF 2023. My goal was to show-off this unique new design, gather feedback, and most importantly, meet people and make connections. By all accounts, it was a success that came with many challenges and lessons learned.

## Building Mini-V.001
* Convert Tiny-T into a Mini-V
* Improve on #0 with design updates
* Use all CF-ASA with 0.6 nozzle
* Y rails
* Front idlers + XY Joints
* Electronics bay and rear Z rail redesign
* Finalize panel mounting design
* State prior to disassembly
