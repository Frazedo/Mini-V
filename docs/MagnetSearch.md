# Bed Magnets
Found 20x10x5mm SaCo magnets on Ali but they are no longer available, they are a great size and work fantastic

Found "High Temp N42SH Neodymium Magnets 1 in x 1/2 in x 1/4 in Rare Earth Block" should work as well with printed adjustments
Found "SmCo Magnets 1/2 in x 1/2 in x 1/4 in Samarium Cobalt Block" also could work with reduced kinematics, in my experience, these would probably be fine

20 mm = .787 inches 3/4
10 mm = .4 inches 1/2
5 mm = .2 inches 1/8
