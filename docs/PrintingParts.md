# Printing Parts

## Main parts

Many of the main parts are structural. They were specifically designed to be printable with an 0.6mm nozzle. As such, we recommend a carbon fiber or glass filled filament for extra rigidity.

Totally optional, but you may wish to zero out top/bottom layers for first 3mm. This will expose infill pattern (very pretty) and show-off any re-inforcement voids.

| Setting               | Value                       |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Nozzle                | 0.6mm                       |
| Filament              | CF ABS or ASA (PETG maybe)  |
| Infill                | 25% (honeycomb)             |
| Extrusion width       | 0.6mm                       |
| Perimeters            | 4                           |
| Top layers            | 5                           |
| Bottom layers         | 4                           |

## Accent parts

Most of these parts are designed for 0.4mm nozzle. Choose a bright color to make them "pop"!

| Setting               | Value                       |
| -----------           | --------------------------- |
| Nozzle                | 0.4mm                       |
| Filament              | ABS or ASA (bright color)   |
| Infill                | 40% (honeycomb)             |
| Extrusion width       | 0.4mm                       |
| Perimeters            | 4                           |
| Top layers            | 5                           |
| Bottom layers         | 4                           |

## Mesh parts

The parts look solid but you need to print them with your favorite breathable infill with no top or bottom layers. I prefer honeycomb at 25%.

| Setting               | Value                       |
| -----------           | --------------------------- |
| Nozzle                | 0.4mm                       |
| Filament              | ABS or ASA (bright color)   |
| Infill                | 25% (honeycomb)             |
| Extrusion width       | 0.4mm                       |
| Perimeters            | 4                           |
| Top layers            | 0 for first 3mm             |
| Bottom layers         | 0 for first 3mm             |
