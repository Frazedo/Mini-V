# Mini-V

Mini-V is a compact core-xy printer with a build volume of 180mmÂ³ using 2020 extrusions. The printer is designed to maximize print volume with a minimal footprint.

*The design is stable with over 400 hours of print time on two alpha builds. As of mid-2024 we are entering an open beta and looking for early adopters.*

## Adopted Community Designs
Although Mini-V is almost a completely custom design, it does utilize the following community designs:

- [Boop](https://github.com/PrintersForAnts/Boop) by `MasterMynd` 
- [Peck](https://github.com/chirpy2605/voron/tree/main/general/Experimental/Peck) by `chirpy2605` 
- [DragonBurner](https://github.com/chirpy2605/voron/tree/main/V0/Dragon_Burner) by `chirpy2605`
- Inspiration from Voron Trident and is derived from Tiny-T frame dimensions
